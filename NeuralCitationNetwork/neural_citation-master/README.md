## Requirements
The neural_citation.yml file contains a list of packages used to implement this model. Of particular importance are:
* python==3.7.3
* pytorch==1.1.0
* torchtext==0.3.1
* tensorboard==1.14.0
* spacy==2.1.6
* gensim==3.8.0
* nltk==3.4.4
* pandas==0.25.0
* tqdm==4.32.2  

For training the model it is recommended to use the GPU version of Pytorch instead.

## Getting started  
Install dependencies and clone the repo. The training notebook contains a training  template.
The evaluation notebook shows an example of how model evaluations can be run.
Note that both training and evaluation functions are optimized for use in notebooks as they use
tqdm_notebook progress bars. When running these functions from a script this needs to be changed.
