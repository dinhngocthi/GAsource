Reviewer A:

The authors updated the previous version following the reviewers comments. However the updates are minor, mainly in writing corrections and insignificant experiment results additions. 

Related work should compare with Pex from Microsoft Research. In comparison some related work, e.g. Symbolic PathFinder, the authors pointed out that these approaches have difficulties with loop, pointers, arrays,.. but the experimental results in the paper did not show authors' approach solver the limitations of the other approaches.

--------------
--> We added our experimental result which was compared to constraint-based test data approaches in the section [5. Experimental analysis]
--------------

statistical in 4.1 seems not a right word, I think you just do a search for all paths of a CFG.
--------------
--> We call it static analysis because by not having to execute the program, we still generate control flow graph (CFG) from the given program, and then traverse this CFG to find out all test paths.
Also we add this explaination in the section 4.1.
--------------

The authors should make more comparisions and more significant experimental results that show their approach and tool are better than may others state-of-the-art approaches and tools in the literature, not only small advancement of [9].
